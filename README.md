=>>>>>>I RECOMMEND TO CHECK THE OTHER BRANCH WHICH I MADE THE ADD SECTION TO PO-UP!!!!<<<<<<<=
Or uncomment in the index.html row-37 and in main.js row-11 and the pop up option for the add-window would appear

I added remove and complete option, to remove click the red-X to complete press on the item.
Hover on items and buttons.
Animation when item adds to list, removes from list 
and if (you use the branch with the pop up) {
  it fades in.
}
The back  of the title background changes.
I used the local storage.
You can also uncomment in the index.html row-37 and in main.js row-11 and the pop up option for the add-window would appear.
